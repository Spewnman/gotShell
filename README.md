Do what you will with this code, the only thing you cannot do with this code is hold me accountable for any issues
or bugs that it may cause. This is my hobby, not my profession so there will be bugs as long as I am the only contributor.

CURRENTLY:
- Creates a "shell" that you can send text to.
- Text can be "typed" using different speeds and colors.
- Requires a DIV with "gotShell" class AND ID to be the container for the Shell.

FUTURE FEATURES
- Automatic creation of element(s) from code.
- Custom CSS styles will be supported.
- Allow users to enter commands that will be interpreted by back end PHP Scripts using JSON.
- Users can create custom PHP commands to be ran on the server side.
- Integration of many common DOS and *NIX commands.
- Title bar with ability to minimize, maximize and close shells, and probably an options item.
- Right click customizable menu.
